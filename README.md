#### _This is an exercise of branching, looping and other foundational C# concepts to build working console applications.5/5/2020_

### Made by Nitun Dtta and Matt Stroud
## Description

_This is a console app that 'guesses' what number a user is thinking of and will continue until the program guesses the correct number._


## Setup/Installation Requirements
1. Clone this repository from GitHub.
2. Open the downloaded directory in a text editor of your choice.
  (VSCode, Atom, etc.)
3. To install the REPL dotnet script, run dotnet tool install -g dotnet-script in your terminal.
4. Run the program with the command dotnet build.


## Specs


1. The app should ask the user to pick a number between 1-100.
2. The app should then 'guess' a number and ask whether the user's number is higher or lower  than the 'guessed' number.
3. If the user says the number is lower, the program should guess a lower number. If the user says the number is higher, the program should guess a higher number.
The game should go on until the program guesses the correct number.

Input:Program: Would you like to play the higher/lower game? (Yes/No)
Output:User: Yes.
Output:Program: Okay.
Input:Program: Is your number higher or lower than 50? (Higher/Lower/Correct)
